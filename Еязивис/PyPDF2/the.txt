This page provides various texts in English for reading. These texts are useful for both schoolchildren and students. Recommended for beginners and those with limited vocabulary. Remember one rule: "The level of English proficiency is directly proportional to the amount of text that has passed through your brain." So we boldly begin to read at least two texts in one day.
